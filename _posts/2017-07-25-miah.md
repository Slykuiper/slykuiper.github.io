I've recently been tasked with animating several designs for the opening of live events. Animating 15 - 20 seconds of motion with the remainder of time being a still frame set to music. It was a very fun job, with a lot of creative freedom and a variety of designs to work with. Sourcing matching music to fit the mood of the visuals was a bit challenging but rewarding to see it compliment the designs.
