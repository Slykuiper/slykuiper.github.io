Since mid-2012, I've been creating edits and montages for [Toribash](http://toribash.com), the turn based ragdoll fighting game developed by [Nabi Studios](http://www.nabistudios.com/). It's where I began, got my name, and learned my craft. I don't frequent the game much nowadays, but I poke around here and there. Here's a collection of some of my favorite videos I've created, with a short description for each. [Click here for the full playlist on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLGAb4JjeiLFlOvwHNWf8HXfI2ouRH-cMs). Replays and music cited in the youtube description of every edit.

I created this in a few hours across two days. Check the description for more information.

An unfinished collaboration with Toribash user Roboman, he never finished his part. I was satisfied with my part so I published what I had.

A clean, fast-paced edit where I started using the default characters' looks for each replay. [Still frames available on imgur](http://imgur.com/a/Afnbb).

One of many edits dedicated to the player User (cat, teburu, quilava, etc). Her replays and my style fit perfectly to create many edits varying genres and moods.

A sincere angelic video with contrasting ties to another edit entitled [στοιχειωμένος](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E0BjVKWNHz0&index=8&list=PLGAb4JjeiLFlOvwHNWf8HXfI2ouRH-cMs). Made within 5 days of eachother on an inspiration binge, I'm proud of the outcome.

A very fast-paced collaboration between Avikaa and I. When Infinite Daps by RL Grime and Baauer dropped, we found an excuse to work on a project together.
