Back again in celebration of the Chinese New Year, [Laura](https://twitter.com/lauraporat) organized 10 of us from the motioncollabs group to animate the 12 Chinese zodiac animals. The idea was for each of us to animate a zodiac animal in the style of a badass video game character intro. Our restrictions were a 4-color palette and 5 seconds to express our character.

I designed and animated the rooster. I originally set out to do an exaggerated, comical approach with a bigger comb and stubbier legs but went with a more realistic figure that turned out to be more fun to animate. I rigged up the tail with [a ton of duik bones](/assets/images/work/other/motioncollab_sly6.png) set to loop seamlessly with the wiggle() expression. The initial pass for the run cycle was blocked out with a reference video and refined towards the end of the deadline. Designing and animating the main scenes came hours before the deadline was over. If you're feeling nosy, [here's the 595 KB project file](https://www.dropbox.com/s/8epivixt5rqrffk/Rooster_sly2.rar?dl=0).

I'm happy with the outcome, it was an exciting project to see come together that gave me a chance to dig deeper into rigging and animation. For motioncollab four, we're doing a big quilt project with about **50 members**. Sign-ups have closed and we start on the 25th, stay tuned for post when that project closes.
