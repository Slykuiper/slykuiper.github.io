I got the opportunity to create an identity for Senpupi, an upcoming Twitch streamer. The identity package is the full deal, containing all of the assets needed for a quality stream. He had a few ideas for the style and imagery and gave me a lot of creative freedom. Dark, gritty visuals with a sacred/geometric twist. 

Included in the package:
* Profile Picture
* Profile Banner/Cover Image
* Info Panels
* Video Player Banner (offline screen)
* AFK/Break screen (animated)
* Starting soon screen (animated)
* Stream Overlays
* TwitchAlert Popup Titles (animated)

Animated Twitch Alert panels, these visuals are triggered on stream when a viewer donates, followers, or subscribes to the stream. These are triggered via [Streamlabs](https://streamlabs.com).
