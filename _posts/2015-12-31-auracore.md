Auracore, a collection of modders and developers working to balance and improve a popular fps series, approached me looking for visuals for the game client. They wanting something digital, hi-tech, and glitchy to be played as the intro graphic for their game client. I went with a dark theme that displayed the text as if it was on a broken LCD display. Their mantra "Made for the players, not the profit" signifies that their focus was to provide the best gaming experience for the players rather than making money.
