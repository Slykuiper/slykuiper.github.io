  However, video editing for me is an escape from real life, it is something I consider to be sacred and of sentimental value as it has allowed me to express myself artistically like nothing else.
  My stance on the Call of Duty editing scene currently is that it serves as a superb introduction to video editing and has a lot to offer anyone with a passion for moving image.

Video games are expressive, and video editors in the gaming community use them as a medium to evoke emotion. This is a collection of my personal favorites I've created over the past few years.

The Kingdom Hearts series was my main inspiration for this edit, it's my favorite video game series. The style I went with for this edit mimicks my older edit Acedia, with the first half of the video being light, and the second half being dark.

### Anagnorisis and Peripeteia

This edit was created around the theme of critical discovery (anagnorisis) and a reversal of fortune or circumstances (peripeteia). More so, it refers to the personal reflection I had while working on my movie mod for Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2. After months of coding my mod, I developed a system that would allow me to manipulate in-game assets, such as character models and animations, to create story driven machinimas with ease. You can watch one of my older edits entitled "[Empty Airport](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYH-ks5rvKE)", which was an early proof of concept video depicting this system. Anagnorisis and Peripeteia serves as the first major story driven project I made with this system. [Check out the still frames here](http://imgur.com/a/anxsz).

My first edit after being accepted into the editing team [RelativeMinds](http://youtube.com/user/relativeminds), I was determined to show my creativity by producing visuals for mw2 that were unique to my style. I had the music (Polo - Amen) bookmarked for a few weeks, waiting for motivation to kick in. Inspired by the music and it's song name, I went with a slight biblical theme for this edit. A specific animation, **pb_stand_death_shoulderback**, in Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2 played an important role in this video. The animation fits well into the scene 14 seconds into the video, a ripoff of ["The Creation of Adam"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Creation_of_Adam) by [Michelangelo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michelangelo), where I replaced Adam with a dying soldier that had the animation that resembled Adam's pose in the painting.

One of my most popular edits, Acedia was based on the theme of light and dark. I gained full membership status under [Verum](https://www.youtube.com/user/VerumEditing) with this video. When it came out, it had a huge improvement in flow from my previous edits. Some small custom weapon changes and ingame effects through the use of my mod were eyecatching.

My accepted application to [Verum](https://www.youtube.com/user/VerumEditing), a somber singleplayer edit that seperated me from other MW2 editors. Nobody else in the community at the time created singleplayer edits as it wasn't a documented process.

This was my first black ops 1 edit, I really like the song choice and the feeling it conveys. The recording process was confusing at first but once I got the hang of it I really liked editing this game.
