I started experimenting with DUIK for character rigging and animation in After Effects. So far I've created two rigs that I'm happy with, I learned a bunch of new expression snippets and a bit about character design. I used this an opportunity to learn a bit about Illustrator, however it's still quicker for me to create/modify characters in After Effects.

I got inspired to create the bicycle and unicycle rigs after seeing [/u/Raivion](https://www.reddit.com/u/Raivion)'s [Tank Tracks](https://www.reddit.com/r/AfterEffects/comments/5sp4ux/quick_tip_tankrubber_tracks_in_after_effects_and/) tutorial in [/r/aftereffects](https://www.reddit.com/r/AfterEffects/).
