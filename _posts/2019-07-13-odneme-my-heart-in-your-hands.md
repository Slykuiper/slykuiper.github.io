Still on my [Orb](http://slykuiper.com/white-katana-sorcerer) kick, we worked with another outer-spaced theme. This time the scene is placed inside of a space vessel looking out of a large window towards a nearby planet. The outer space scene is made inside of After Effects while the interior walls and window were made in Cinema4D and rendered with Redshift. The lights are animated with Trapcode Soundkeys and some subtle Glow with a wiggle expression.
