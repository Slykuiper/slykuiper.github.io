Since I've upgraded my setup, over the past few weeks I've had a growing interest in capturing high resolution video game screenshots. I've had this interest early on when [creating video game edits](http://slykuiper.com/call-of-duty-edits), but only recently had a renewed interest in the early pre-alpha of Unreal Tournament. It's very open source oriented for the community to be involved and develop the game. Studio development has stopped in the last 6 months to shift focus towards Unreal's battle royale title Fortnite.

I've put up the raw screenshots for download at full, half, and quarter resolutions. [You can access dropbox folder here](https://www.dropbox.com/sh/hi532ln2c39iaa5/AAAVjtKQjMeUH3xTy-vpPz0ga?dl=0), feel free to use them as you wish for wallpapers or media. All full resolution screenshots are at least 4k and hover around 9000 pixels maximum for width or height. Below are quarter resolution, low file-size thumbnails to see the compositions without eating bandwidth.
